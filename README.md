# dybtProjekt
A repository for the course 02456 Deep Learning at DTU

### Data Structure

The data required for this project is organized in the following directory structure:

```plaintext
data/
├── cifar-100-python/
├── stanford-cars-real-train-fewshot/
└── stanford-cars-synthetic-classwise-16/



- **`cifar-100-python/`**: This directory contains the CIFAR-100 dataset, structured as per the Python version distribution format. Ensure the data files are compatible with the project requirements.
  
- **`stanford-cars-real-train-fewshot/`**: This directory includes a few-shot dataset for the real Stanford Cars training set.
  
- **`stanford-cars-synthetic-classwise-16/`**: This directory contains a synthetic dataset for Stanford Cars, with 16 synthetic samples per class. The synthetic data is organized by class and supports testing generalization with synthetic images.
